# RNN-LSTM-and-GRU-to-classify-sentiment-on-IMDB-data
In this project, we will train three types of RNNs: "vanilla" RNN, LSTM and GRU to predict the sentiment on IMDB reviews.
Keras provides a convenient interface to load the data and immediately encode the words into integers (based on the most common words). This will save you a lot of the drudgery that is usually involved when working with raw text.

The IMDB is data consists of 25000 training sequences and 25000 test sequences. The outcome is binary (positive/negative) and both outcomes are equally represented in both the training and the test set.

Walk through the followinng steps to prepare the data and the building of an RNN model.
